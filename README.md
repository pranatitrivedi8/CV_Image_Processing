- Local Histogram and global Histogram

Global histogram equalization (GHE) is a common technique used to enhance image contrast by utilizing the histogram information of the input image to create its transformation function. However, it usually fails to adapt with the local image brightness features. By contrast, Local histogram equalization (LHE) is suitable for handling the local feature; whereas it suffers from halo or blocking artifacts and requires high computation power.
